## Statistics For Data Science
Statistics for data science are used to provide a general description of data. This includes the use of measures of centrality (such as mean, median, and mode) and measures of dispersion (such as range, variance, and standard deviation) to describe the characteristics of the data.
in statistics there is Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions from data samples taken from a larger population. Using techniques such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis, statistics allows data scientists to make generalizations from a sample of data to an entire population Apart from that, there is also Statistical Modeling, Data Visualization, Data Filtering and Data Filtering.

## Hyphotesis Testing
Hypothesis testing or hypothesis testing is a method of data analysis that is used to make statistical decisions about a proposed statement or hypothesis regarding a population or data.The proposed hypothesis consists of two types: Null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1).
- pvalue is the value resulting from calculating the differences from the study
- The T-test is used when you want to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of the group
- Alpha is used as an error tolerance limit in conducting hypothesis testing. The frequently used alpha level is 0.05 / 5%
## Machine Learning - Simple Linear Regression
Machine Learning (ML), or Machine Learning, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that is concerned with the development of algorithms and computer models that enable systems to learn patterns and information from data, and improve their performance with experience.
### Machine Learning Functions:
1. Classification: Machine Learning is used to classify data into different categories or groups. Examples include classification of emails as spam or not spam, or disease pattern recognition based on medical symptoms.
2. Regression: ML is used to build models that can predict numeric or continuous values, such as predicting home prices based on certain features or weather forecasting.
3. Recommendations: ML is used to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their behavior and preferences, such as product recommendations on e-commerce sites or content recommendations on streaming platforms.
4. Prediction and Forecasting: ML is used to build predictive models to estimate future outcomes, such as sales forecasting, stock prediction, and demand forecasting.
### Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a regression method used when there is an assumed linear relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y). This relationship can be represented in the form of a straight line called a regression line. The goal of Simple Linear Regression is to find the regression line that best describes the linear relationship between X and Y.
In simple linear regression, there is model evaluation in Machine Learning Regression which is an important process that aims to measure the performance of the regression model that has been built. Model evaluation helps us understand the extent to which our model can accurately predict target variables.

## Matplotlib and Seaborn
### Matplotlib 
Matplotlib is a very flexible and powerful library for creating graphs and visualizations in the Python programming language,Python library which is very useful in data analysis to create data visualizations.
several types of graphs as follows:
- line graphs
- scatter plots
- bar plots
- histograms
- heatmaps
- etc
### Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python library built on Matplotlib and specifically designed for creating interesting and informative statistical visualizations. It provides high-level functionality that makes it easy for users to create data visualizations with minimal effort. Seaborn has an aesthetic default style, which ensures your visualizations look professional.seaborn provides high-level functions that make it easier to create data visualizations such as distribution plots, regression plots, pair plots, and others that are very useful in data analysis.
### matplotlib and seaborn differences in data analysis
Here are the main differences between Matplotlib and Seaborn in the context of data analysis:
1. In terms of Main Goals:
- Matplotlib: The main goal of Matplotlib is to provide basic tools for creating highly customized graphs and visualizations. It can be used in a variety of contexts, including exploratory visualization and communication of highly specialized data analysis results.
- Seaborn: Seaborn is specifically designed for statistical data visualization and has high-level functions that make it easy to create data visualizations such as distribution plots, pair plots, and regression plots. Seaborn is more focused on presenting statistical data with an attractive aesthetic.
  
2. From Statistical Visualization:
- Matplotlib: You can create statistical visualizations with Matplotlib, but it requires extra effort to create plots such as distribution plots and regression plots.
- Seaborn: Seaborn has special functions for creating statistical visualizations with minimal effort, such as distribution plots, pair plots, and regression plots.
  
3. In terms of code complexity:
- Matplotlib: Matplotlib code tends to be longer and requires more lines to create highly customized visualizations. so it is necessary to determine every visual detail carefully.
- Seaborn: Seaborn uses more concise and readable code to create common visualizations. This makes it a good choice if you want to create visualizations with simpler code.
